Sheldon is a fast, configurable, command-line tool to manage your shell plugins.

## How does it work?

Plugins are specified in a [TOML](https://toml.io) configuration file and
Sheldon renders an install script using user configurable templates.

A `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc` that uses Sheldon simply contains the following.

```sh
eval "$(sheldon source)"
```

Sheldon can manage GitHub or Git repositories, Gists, arbitrary remote scripts
or binaries, local plugins, and inline plugins. Plugins are installed and
updated in parallel and as a result Sheldon is blazingly fast.
