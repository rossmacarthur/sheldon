This section demonstrates the configuration file contents for some common
installation practices as well how to configure popular plugins and themes.

## Deferred loading of plugins in Zsh

A commonly desired feature of shell plugin managers is deferred loading of
plugins because of the massive increase in speed that it provides. Because
Sheldon is not written in a shell language it cannot provide the level of
integration that other plugin managers can. However, it is pretty easy to get
deferred loading working with Sheldon using
[romkatv/zsh-defer](https://github.com/romkatv/zsh-defer).

Firstly, you should add `zsh-defer` as a plugin.

```toml
[plugins.zsh-defer]
github = "romkatv/zsh-defer"
```

Important: the `zsh-defer` plugin definition should be placed before any plugins
that will use the `defer` template. Sheldon always processes plugins in the
order they are defined in the config file.

Then add a template that calls `zsh-defer source` instead of just `source`.

```toml
[templates]
defer = "{% for file in files %}zsh-defer source \"{{ file }}\"\n{% endfor %}"
```

Now any plugin that you want to defer you can apply the `defer` template. For
example if you wanted to defer loading of `zsh-syntax-highlighting`.

```toml
[plugins.zsh-syntax-highlighting]
github = "zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting"
apply = ["defer"]
```

## Overriding the PATH template

The built-in **PATH** template adds the directory path to the beginning of the
`PATH` variable, we might want to change it to the be added at the end. We could
do this like this

```toml
[templates]
PATH = 'export PATH="$PATH:{{ dir }}"'
```

You can then apply it to the plugin like this

```toml
[plugins.example]
github = "owner/repo"
apply = ["source", "PATH"]
```

**Note:** this would change the behavior of **PATH** for *all* plugins using it.

## Zsh frameworks

### [ohmyzsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh)

Add the following to the Sheldon config file.

```

Add the following to your `~/.zshrc` file.

```sh
# ~/.zshrc

export ZSH="$HOME/.local/share/sheldon/repos/github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh"

# Oh My Zsh settings here

eval "$(sheldon source)"
```
