# üìù Release notes

## 0.7.0

*October 13th, 2022*

### Breaking changes

- [Use XDG directories by default.][c3f87dd] Previously Sheldon tried to
  automatically detect whether the user wanted to use XDG. This proved difficult
  and Sheldon now follows the [XDG directory structure] by default. Sheldon will
  log a warning if the old directory `~/.sheldon` is still used as the config
  directory.

  To use the new location you should move the config file from
  `~/.sheldon/plugins.toml` to `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/sheldon/plugins.toml`, which
  will be `~/.config/sheldon/plugins.toml` if the XDG variable is unset. You can
  then safely delete the old `~/.sheldon` directory.

  If you wish to preserve the existing behaviour you can simply set the
  following environment variables.
  ```sh
  SHELDON_CONFIG_DIR="$HOME/.sheldon"
  SHELDON_DATA_DIR="$HOME/.sheldon"
  ```

- [Update template engine.][c2127c3] Stop using Handlebars in favour of
  [Jinja-like templating](https://github.com/rossmacarthur/upon). This will only
  affect you if you were using custom templates.

- [Only apply templates per plugin.][708bd9e] This effectively removes the
  `each` field from the template configuration. Any templates that are applied
  to each file in a plugin need to now use a for loop. For example:
  ```
  {% for file in files %}
  source "{{ file }}"
  {% endfor %}
  ```

- [Remove clone, download dir and lock file options.][4bbbff4] These paths are
  no longer configurable, only the data directory is configurable.

### Features

- [Conditional sourcing of plugins using profiles.][#143] This allows you to
  specify a profile that a plugin is applicable to. The plugin will only be
  included when Sheldon is run with that profile. A separate lock file will be
  used for each profile.

  Plugins can specify the profiles using the `profiles` key.
  ```toml
  [plugins.example]
  github = "owner/repo"
  profiles = ["<name>"]
  ```

  You can specify the profile in two ways:
  - Command line flag: `--profile <name>`
  - Environment variable: `SHELDON_PROFILE=<name>`.

- [Support cargo-binstall.][#144] This allows Sheldon to be installed using
  `cargo binstall sheldon` which will fetch the release artifact for Sheldon
  from the GitHub release.

### Fixes

- [Fix not updating Git source branches after force pushes.][d254a6a] Previously
  repositories with a branch that was force pushed wouldn't be updated by
  `sheldon lock --update`.
- Many other fixes and internal improvements.

  compile time and binary size.

  re-open it or overwrite.

## 0.6.0

*October 16th, 2020*

### Breaking changes

- [Support XDG directory structure.][#110] If any XDG environment variable is
  set then Sheldon will adopt the [XDG directory structure] by default. The
  config file will be located at `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/sheldon/plugins.toml` and
  downloaded data will be located in `$XDG_CONFIG_DATA/sheldon`.
  <small>(Contributed by
  [**@tapeinosyne**](https://github.com/tapeinosyne).)</small>
- [Change the default lock file location.][10c64a3] For non-XDG directory
  structures the lock file now always defaults to
  `$SHELDON_DATA_DIR/plugins.lock`. It previously was the config file path with
  a `.lock` extension.
- [Remove the Sheldon root.][#112] The `root` directory has been replaced by
  individual directories for configuration and data: `config_dir` and
  `data_dir`. Both default to `$HOME/.sheldon`, the old default `root`.
  <small>(Contributed by
  [**@tapeinosyne**](https://github.com/tapeinosyne).)</small>

  If you used Sheldon's defaults, everything will just keep working as it did;
  no action needs to be taken. Otherwise, you may refer to this migration table:

  |                    | Old                   | New                         |
  | -----------------: | --------------------- | --------------------------- |
  |       Config paths | `<root>/plugins.toml` | `<config_dir>/plugins.toml` |
  |         Data paths | `<root>/plugins.lock` | `<data_dir>/plugins.lock`   |
  |                    | `<root>/repos`        | `<data_dir>/repos`          |
  |                    | `<root>/downloads`    | `<data_dir>/downloads`      |
  |      Env variables | `SHELDON_ROOT`        | `SHELDON_CONFIG_DIR`        |
  |                    |                       | `SHELDON_DATA_DIR`          |
  |        CLI options | `--root`              | `--config-dir`              |
  |                    |                       | `--data-dir`                |
  | Template variables | `{{ root }}`          | `{{ data_dir }}`            |

- [Auto-detect whether to use colored output.][2be1da7] A new `--color` option
  was added with three values `always`, `auto`, or `never`. By default Sheldon
  will now automatically whether to use colored output or not (`auto`). But you
  can still force Sheldon to always use color or never use color with the
  `--color always` option or `--color never`. The previous `--no-color` option
  has been removed.

### Fixes

- [Fix performance bug introduced in version 0.5.4.][abf2027] A significant drop
  in performance was introduced by switching to the Rust `rayon` package. This
  change has been reverted.
- [Fix `--relock` not being implied for other flags.][bc5f9d7] This fixes a bug
  where passing `--update` or `--reinstall` to the `source` command didn't imply
  `--relock` like the documentation says.

## 0.5.4

*August 14th, 2020*

### Features

- [Support extended glob syntax.][a972c35] This means that `{a,b}` and `!` glob
  patterns can now be used. For example, the following is now valid.

  ```toml
  [plugins.ohmyzsh]
  github = "ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh"
  dir = "lib"
  use = ["{!git,!nvm,*}.zsh]
  ```

### Fixes

- [Fix not erroring out when no files matched for plugin.][aa69e0c] This fixes
  cases where no files would be matched for a plugin and Sheldon would silently
  continue, resulting in no source rendered by `sheldon source`.
- [Update default templates for Bash, `path` and `fpath` are now
  removed.][2a60788] These templates were meaningless in a Bash context.

### Features

- [Add `init` command.][131576d] Adds a new command to Sheldon which initializes
  a config file. Simply run `sheldon init`.
- [Add `shell` config key.][ed872e9] Indicates to Sheldon what type of shell is
  being used. Certain other config values will have different defaults if this
  value is set.
- [Support updating of plugins via `--update` option.][5a8254d] Simply run
  `sheldon lock --update` to update all plugin sources.

## 0.5.0

*May 2nd, 2020*

### Features

- [Add `add` and `remove` commands to edit config.][140d171] These commands will
  edit the config file for you.

  For example

  ```sh
  sheldon add example --github owner/repo --tag v0.1.0
  ```

  will add the following to the config file

  ```toml
  [plugins.example]
  github = "owner/repo"
  tag = "v0.1.0"
  ```

  The following will remove it again.

  ```sh
  sheldon remove example
  ```

- [Add `edit` command.][5b63843] Adds a new command to Sheldon which allows you
  to open the config file in the default editor. Simply run `sheldon edit`.
- [Add initial config file.][75a39b3] When running `add` or `edit` Sheldon will
  attempt to initialize a new config file at `~/.sheldon/plugins.toml`.
- [Warn about unused config keys.][11ff287] Anytime Sheldon loads the config
  file it will log warnings when there are unused config keys. Great for
  catching typos!

[140d171]: https://github.com/rossmacarthur/sheldon/commit/140d17142d5be2b0653f559612aebffbd3c39ce1

### Breaking changes

- [Update default root directory and clone directory.][1845483] The root
  directory now defaults to `~/.sheldon` and the clone directory now defaults to
  `{root}/repos`. To migrate you should do the following:

  ```sh
  mv ~/.zsh ~/.sheldon
  mv ~/.sheldon/repositories ~/.sheldon/repos
  ```

  Or to preserve the old behavior you should export the following before running
  Sheldon.

  ```sh
  export SHELDON_ROOT="$HOME/.zsh"
  export SHELDON_CLONE_DIR="$SHELDON_ROOT/repositories"
  ```

### Fixes

- [Download/clone sources to a temporary path first.][7293cbf]

  This fixes an issue ([#99]) where if someone tried to reinstall they would be
  left without any plugins because they would all be nuked up front prior to
  trying to download them.

### Deprecations

Most of these are still supported, however Sheldon will log a deprecation
warning if you use them.

- [Rename `filename` to `file`][c62600a] This affects both the the config file
  and the template rendering context.
- [Rename `directory` to `dir`.][f8d5647] This affects both the the config file
  and the template rendering context.
- [Rename `protocol` plugin config key to `proto`.][ce4d8e2]
- [Rename `revision` plugin config key to `rev`.][92bb588]
