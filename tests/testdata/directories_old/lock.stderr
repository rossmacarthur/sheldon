[WARNING] using deprecated config file location ~/.sheldon/plugins.toml.

To use the new location move the config file to
~/.config/sheldon/plugins.toml ($XDG_CONFIG_HOME/sheldon/plugins.toml),
~/.sheldon can then be safely deleted.

Or to instead preserve the old behaviour set the following environment variables:
  SHELDON_CONFIG_DIR="$HOME/.sheldon"
  SHELDON_DATA_DIR="$HOME/.sheldon"

See the release notes at https://github.com/rossmacarthur/sheldon for more information.
